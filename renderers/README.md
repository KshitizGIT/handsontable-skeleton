# Handsontable Renderer Skeleton

You can easily assign a custom renderer to a Handsontable instance.
A renderer is basically a function run every time a cell is being rendered.
You can find a sample renderer in the [rendererSkeleton.js](rendererSkeleton.js) file.

You can find additional information on how to implement your renderer to the Handsontable instance in our documentation:
